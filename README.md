# Dall - E, MERN application

<p>Hey guys, Khanisic/Abdul Moid Khan here üëã.</p>
<br/>
<p>Welcome to the Dall-e MERN application where you can generate your ideas and watch the DALL-E API do its magic. Here, you can share your images without having to create an account and view other creators ideas as well.</p>
<br/>
<p>I have used <i>Next.js - A fullstack react framework,</i> to build the project deployed it on vercel. For the backend, I've used MongoDB and used express to power the server.</p>
